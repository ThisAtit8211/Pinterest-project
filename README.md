# Pinterest

This is my Pinterest-inspired website that I built by myself using React, Bootstrap 5, and SCSS.

### Masonry Layout

I was unfamiliar with the Masonry layout, so I read about it today and tried to combine it with Bootstrap 5 to create the Pinterest layout. It turns out that they work well together.

### Unsplash

All of the images are sourced from the Unsplash API, which provides free access to high-quality images for every user.

### Bootstrap

Bootstrap is my go-to framework, as always.

## Problem

I encountered an issue while trying to make the search bar responsive. In the original Pinterest, when you resize the homepage, the search bar resizes smoothly as well. I haven't figured out how to do it yet.
